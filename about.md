I am a cloud engineer at Hitachi Vantara.
Mostly my work includes cloud-based development and deployment using Java, Spring boot, Kafka, Kubernetes, and Helm.
I have a very keen interest in Machine learning and python.
I have worked on AWS and Azure cloud, and is [AWS Associate Developer certified](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/c4529372-c0bd-474e-8b57-b8f15f9c653c).
